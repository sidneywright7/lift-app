# LiftList — Workout Exercise Manager

## Author
Sidney Wright

## Overview
LiftList is a React web app for planning and tracking workout sessions.
Browse a library of 30+ exercises, build a custom workout list,
customize sets and reps, and check off exercises as you complete them.

## How to Use
- Click the Library tab to browse exercises by muscle group
- Use the search bar to find exercises by name
- Click any exercise card to add it to your workout
- Switch to the Workout tab to see your list
- Click the sets/reps numbers to edit them
- Check the checkbox when you finish an exercise
- Click the X button to remove an exercise

## Technologies Used
- React 18
- useReducer (Redux-style state management)
- Vite
- CSS-in-JS
- Google Fonts (Bebas Neue, DM Sans)
- gh-pages

## Ideas for Future Improvement
1. Save workouts to localStorage so they persist after closing the browser
2. Add a rest timer that counts down between sets
3. Allow users to create and save named workout templates like Push Day or Leg Day
4. Add drag and drop to reorder exercises in the workout list
5. Add exercise demonstration GIFs for each movement
